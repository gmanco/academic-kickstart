abstract = {Sharing threat events and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) enables quick and crucial decision making relative to effective countermeasures against cyberattacks. However, the current threat information sharing solutions do not allow easy communication and knowledge sharing among threat detection systems (in particular Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)) exploiting Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Moreover, the interaction with the expert, which represents an important component to gather verified and reliable input data for the ML algorithms, is weakly supported. To address all these issues, ORISHA, a platform for ORchestrated Information SHaring and Awareness enabling the cooperation among threat detection systems and other information awareness components, is proposed here. ORISHA is backed by a distributed Threat Intelligence Platform based on a network of interconnected Malware Information Sharing Platform instances, which enables the communication with several Threat Detection layers belonging to different organizations. Within this ecosystem, Threat Detection Systems mutually benefit by sharing knowledge that allows them to refine the underlying predictive accuracy. Uncertain cases, i.e. examples with low anomaly scores, are proposed to the expert, who acts with the role of oracle in an Active Learning scheme. By interfacing with a honeynet, ORISHA allows for enriching the knowledge base with further positive attack instances and then yielding robust detection models. An experimentation conducted on a well-known Intrusion Detection benchmark demonstrates the validity of the proposed architecture.}
