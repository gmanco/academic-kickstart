  abstract =	 {Modeling information cascades in a social network
                  through the lenses of the ideological leaning of its
                  users can help understanding phenomena such as
                  misinformation propagation and confirmation bias,
                  and devising techniques for mitigating their toxic
                  effects.  In this paper we propose a stochastic
                  model to learn the ideological leaning of each user
                  in a multidimensional ideological space, by
                  analyzing the way politically salient content
                  propagates. In particular, our model assumes that
                  information propagates from one user to another if
                  both users are interested in the topic and
                  ideologically aligned with each other. To infer the
                  parameters of our model, we devise a gradient-based
                  optimization procedure maximizing the likelihood of
                  an observed set of information cascades. Our
                  experiments on real-world political discussions on
                  Twitter and Reddit confirm that our model is able to
                  learn the political stance of the social media users
                  in a multidimensional ideological space.}
