  abstract =	 {We present an online optimization method for
                  time-evolving data streams that can automatically
                  adapt the hyper-parameters of an embedding model.
                  More specifically, we employ the Nelder-Mead
                  algorithm, which uses a set of heuristics to produce
                  and exploit several potentially good configurations,
                  from which the best one is selected and
                  deployed. This step is repeated whenever the
                  distribution of the data is changing.  We evaluate
                  our approach on streams of real-world as well as
                  synthetic data, where the latter is generated in
                  such way that its characteristics change over time
                  (concept drift).  Overall, we achieve good
                  performance in terms of accuracy compared to
                  state-of-the-art AutoML techniques.}
