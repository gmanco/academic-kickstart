abstract: "We propose ARN, a semisupervised anomaly detection and generation method based on adversarial reconstruction. ARN exploits a regularized autoencoder to optimize the reconstruction of variants of normal examples with minimal differences, that are  recognized as outliers. The combination of regularization and adversarial reconstruction helps to stabilize the learning process, which results in both realistic outlier generation and substantial detection capability. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our model improves the current state-of-the-art by valuable margins because of its ability to model the true boundaries of the data manifold. "
