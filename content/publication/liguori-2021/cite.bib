  abstract =	 {We propose ARN, a semisupervised anomaly detection
                  and generation method based on adversarial
                  reconstruction. ARN exploits a regularized
                  autoencoder to optimize the reconstruction of
                  variants of normal examples with minimal
                  differences, that are recognized as outliers. The
                  combination of regularization and adversarial
                  reconstruction helps to stabilize the learning
                  process, which results in both realistic outlier
                  generation and substantial detection
                  capability. Experiments on several benchmark
                  datasets show that our model improves the current
                  state-of-the-art by valuable margins because of its
                  ability to model the true boundaries of the data
                  manifold.}
